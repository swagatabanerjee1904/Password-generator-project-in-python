# Password-generator-project-in-python
In this project, I created a password generator which will create passwords from numbers, letters and symbols chosen by user and the created password will be a strong password.
Here, I write the code of the project. I mainly used random function, range function and for loop in python for this project. This is my first project in Python. So this is an easy one. Looking forward to create more projects using python. Thanks for watching this code!
